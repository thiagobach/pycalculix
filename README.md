# pycalculix

pycalculix is a Python 3 library to automate and build finite element analysis (FEA) models in Calculix.

Meshing uses Calculix or GMSH

## Sample Program
```
# this is from examples/hole-in-plate-full.py
import pycalculix as pyc

# Vertical hole in plate model, make model
proj_name = 'hole-in-plate-full'
model = pyc.FeaModel(proj_name)
model.set_units('m') # this sets dist units to meters

# Define variables we'll use to draw part geometry
diam = 2.0 # hole diam
ratio = 0.45
width = diam/ratio   #plate width
print('D=%f, H=%f, D/H=%f' % (diam, width, diam/width))
length = 2*width  #plate length

# Draw part geometry, you must draw the part CLOCKWISE, x, y = radial, axial
part = pyc.Part(model)
part.goto(length*0.5, -width*0.5)
part.draw_line_ax(width)
part.draw_line_rad(-length)
part.draw_line_ax(-width)
part.draw_line_rad(length)
hole_lines = part.draw_hole(0, 0, diam*0.5, filled=False)
model.set_ediv(hole_lines, 10)
part.chunk()
model.plot_geometry(proj_name+'_geom') # view the geometry

# set loads and constraints
pressure = -1000
model.set_load('press', part.top, pressure)
model.set_load('press', part.bottom, pressure)
model.set_constr('fix', ['P6', 'P8'], 'y')
model.set_constr('fix', ['P4', 'P7'], 'x')

# set part material
mat = pyc.Material('steel')
mat.set_mech_props(7800, 210*(10**9), 0.3)
model.set_matl(mat, part)

# set the element type and mesh database
model.set_eshape('quad', 2)
model.set_etype('plstress', part, 0.1)
model.mesh(1.0, 'gmsh') # mesh 1.0 fineness, smaller is finer
model.plot_elements(proj_name+'_elem')   # plot part elements
model.plot_pressures(proj_name+'_press')
model.plot_constraints(proj_name+'_constr')

# make and solve the model
prob = pyc.Problem(model, 'struct')
prob.solve()

# view and query results
sx = prob.rfile.get_nmax('Sx')
print('Sx_max: %f' % sx)

# Plot results
fields = 'Sx,Sy,S1,S2,S3,Seqv,ux,uy,utot,ex'    # store the fields to plot
fields = fields.split(',')
for field in fields:
    fname = proj_name+'_'+field
    prob.rfile.nplot(field, fname, display=False)
```

## Usage
1. To run a pycalcuix file you have to have pycalulix installed,
see 'Installation' above
2. The you can then write your own pycalculix programs or run one of the example files here:
https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix/tree/master/examples
3. To run a file:  

#### Windows
- Graphical user interface:
  - Double click the file  
  If the .py extension is associated correctly you can double click it to run the .py program
- Console:
  - cd into the directory with your .py file in it, then in the terminal enter
  ```
  python the_program.py
  ```  
  where the_program.py is the name of the file that you are running
  This assumes that python3 is your active python installation

#### Mac/Linux
- Console:
  - cd into the directory with your .py file in it, then in the terminal enter
  ```
  python3 the_program.py
  ```  
  where the_program.py is the name of the file that you are running


## Elements Supported:
Axisymmetric, plane stress, and plane strain elements are supported.

- First and second order triangles and quadrilaterals are supported.
  - First order elments only have corner nodes
  - Second order elements have corner and midside nodes

Second order elements produce more accurate results
Setting element divisions on lines is supported


## Geometry Building
- One can build separate parts made of points, lines, arcs, and areas.
- Straight lines and arcs are currently supported.
- One can draw a part made of straight lines, then smooth out corners by adding arcs with the part method: part.fillet_lines(L1, L2, arc_radius)
- The new arc will be tangent to both adjacent lines.


## Loading
- Force loading
- Constant pressure
- Linearly varying pressure (water pressure)
- Gravity
- Rotational speed forces
- Displacement constraints
- Loads are stored on geometry primitives (points lines, areas) and can be
applied before or after meshing.


## Files Produced
Meshing and solving are done in the background using cgx or gmsh for meshing, and Calculix ccx for solving.

Files Used:
- .fbd (Calculix cgx gemetry file)
- .inp (Calculix solver input file, or mesh definition)
- .geo (Gmsh geometry file)
- .msh (Gmsh native mesh file)
- .frd (Calculix ccx nodal results file, values are at nodes and were created by interpolating element integration point results back to the nodes)
- .dat (Calculix ccx element results file, includes integration point results)


## Uninstall
#### Windows
```
pycalculix-remove-feaprograms
pip uninstall pycalculix
```
#### Mac/Linux
```
pycalculix-remove-feaprograms
pip3 uninstall pycalculix

Initial Release: December 2014


## Change Log

#### 0.9.4 (github only)
- removed gmsh and calculix
- moved dist and documentation building and example cleanup into make file
- changed the license to Apache 2.0
- added command line tool to install/uninstall gmsh and ccx for windows/mac os x/ubuntu
  - pycalculix-add-feaprograms
  - pycalculix-remove-feaprograms
- fixed bug where frd files could no longer be read

#### 0.9.3  
- ADDED: multiple parts with contacts
  - See example files: pipe-crush-elastic.py, pinned-plate.py
- ADDED: Import CAD geometry from dxf file
  - See pycalculix.CadImporter
  - Examples:
    - import-dxf.py
- ADDED: Element results plotting added
  - Element results plotting:   pycalculix.Problem.rfile.eplot()
  - Nodal results plotting:     pycalculix.Problem.rfile.nplot()
  - Number Formatting:
    - Strain results now use scientific formatting
    - Others use nearest 10**3 suffixes
  - Max and min values now listed above the colorbar
- ADDED: method to draw an arc by swept angle in degrees
  - part.draw_arc_angle(degrees_ccw, center_x, center_y)
- ADDED: min_val and max_val can now be passed to eplot and nplot
  - This lets the user set the results range that they want to see:
  - min_val <= colored results <= max_val
  - Values under and over are greyed out, darker under, lighter over
- ADDED: internal holes in parts
  - One can make circular holes, or draw complicated holes.
  - See examples:
    - hole-in-plate-full.py, multihole.py
- ADDED: Added set_ediv method to FeaModel class.
  - This method sets the number of elements on a line.
  - line.set_ediv still works.
- ADDED: Robust selection object: feamodel.view
  - This object is feamodel.view Most important methods are:
    - view.select_all, view.select, view.allsel_under
    - All plotting now uses the current selection set
  - SYNTAX: updated how parts, materials, problems are made
    - Make part:
      - pycalculix.FeaModel.make_part or pycalculix.Part
    - Make material:
      - pycalculix.FeaModel.make_matl or pycalculix.Material
    - Make problem (previously called model):
      - pycalculix.FeaModel.make_problem or pycalculix.Problem
    - Make Results File:
      - pycalculix.Problem.rfile or pycalculix.ResultsFile(problem)
- FIX: Plotting fix, closing triangles in the correct direction in matplotlib
- DOC: All code separated into modules for clarity.
- DOC: Docstrings added to all classes + methods + functions
- PLOTTING: Closed areas are now filled in yellow when plotting geometry.
- PLOTTING: Signed line names are shown and internal to the area.
- BACKEND: Implemented signed line and signed arc class.
  - Pressures can now be applied on these signed lines.
  - Many methods and variables made private to clean up name space.

## Developer Todo:
- on win32 in problem.py, is `__fix_frd` still needed?
- if it is, fix the error message in it
- confirm that set_ediv still works, remove the past merge if that broke it
- add images to the readme
- add new release on github release branch
- add new release on pypi
